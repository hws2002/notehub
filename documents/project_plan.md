Project Plan: Personalized Knowledge Graph from ChatGPT History1. Vision & GoalsVision: To create a dynamic and interactive personalized knowledge graph, similar to Obsidian's graph view, by processing and visualizing the concepts and connections within a user's ChatGPT conversation history. This tool will help users understand the evolution of their ideas, identify knowledge gaps, and generate new content based on their existing thought patterns.Core Goals:Visualize Knowledge: Transform raw ChatGPT conversations into an intuitive and interactive node-based graph.Extract Key Concepts: Automatically identify and extract key entities, topics, and ideas from conversations to serve as nodes.Identify Connections: Establish and visualize relationships between these extracted concepts.Discover Gaps: Highlight areas in the knowledge graph that are less developed, suggesting opportunities for further exploration.Generate Content: Utilize an AI model (like Gemini) to generate new ideas, summaries, or questions based on selected nodes or identified gaps in the graph.Focus on Prototyping: Prioritize creating a functional prototype quickly to test core ideas before committing to a specific long-term technology stack.2. Key FeaturesPhase 1: Core Functionality - The FoundationData Ingestion & Processing:Import ChatGPT history from JSON files.Parse the JSON to extract user prompts and AI responses.Clean and pre-process the text data (e.g., remove irrelevant formatting).Knowledge Extraction (Entity Recognition):Process the text to identify key concepts (nouns, technical terms, names, etc.). These will become the "nodes" in our graph.Initial approach: Simple keyword or noun phrase extraction.Advanced approach: Use a language model to identify more nuanced concepts.Relationship Identification:Determine the connections ("edges") between nodes.Initial approach: If two concepts appear within the same conversation or within a certain number of messages from each other, create an edge.Advanced approach: Use a language model to understand the type of relationship (e.g., "is related to," "is a type of," "contradicts").Basic Graph Visualization:Render the nodes and edges on an interactive canvas.Users can pan, zoom, and drag nodes.Clicking a node highlights it and its immediate connections.Phase 2: Intelligence & InteractionGap Identification:Develop an algorithm to analyze the graph's structure.Identify "orphan" nodes (few connections) or sparse clusters.Visually flag these areas on the graph as potential knowledge gaps.Provide a simple "Gap Analysis" report (e.g., "You've talked a lot about 'React' but very little about 'State Management.'").AI-Powered Content Generation:Allow the user to select one or more nodes.Send the selected concepts to a generative AI model (Gemini).Provide options for the AI to:"Brainstorm connections" between selected nodes."Generate a summary" of the selected topics."Ask probing questions" to fill a knowledge gap.Display the generated content in a sidebar or modal window.Phase 3: Usability & RefinementNode & Edge Management:Allow users to manually merge duplicate nodes.Allow users to edit node names.Allow users to add or remove connections manually.Search & Filtering:Implement a search bar to find specific nodes within the graph.Add filters to show/hide nodes based on criteria (e.g., date of conversation, number of connections).Data Export:Allow users to export their knowledge graph data (e.g., as JSON or a graph-specific format).3. Development Framework (Step-by-Step)This project can be broken down into manageable steps. The key is to build a simple, end-to-end version first and then layer on complexity.Step 1: The "Tracer Bullet" PrototypeGoal: Make data visible from start to finish.Tasks:Write a script that takes one hardcoded ChatGPT JSON file.Extract only the most frequent 20 nouns from the entire conversation. These are your nodes.If two nouns appear in the same message, create an edge between them.Use a simple JavaScript library (like D3.js, Vis.js, or Cytoscape.js) to draw this basic graph in a web browser.Outcome: A very rough but functional graph. This proves the concept.Step 2: Add Interactivity & IntelligenceGoal: Make the graph useful and intelligent.Tasks:Allow the user to upload their own JSON file.Refine the node extraction logic. Use an API call to a model like Gemini to ask, "What are the 5 most important concepts in this text?" for each conversation.Implement the "Gap Identification" feature by finding nodes with only one connection.Integrate the "Content Generation" feature. Add a button that appears when a node is clicked. When pressed, it sends the node's text to Gemini with a prompt like, "Generate 3 follow-up questions about [Node Name]."Step 3: Build the Application ShellGoal: Make it feel like a real application.Tasks:Design a simple user interface with a main area for the graph and a sidebar for displaying information and AI-generated content.Add search and basic filtering capabilities.Implement the ability to save the processed graph state so the user doesn't have to re-upload the JSON file every time.Step 4: Refine and ExpandGoal: Improve the quality and depth of the features.Tasks:Improve the relationship detection logic (e.g., analyze the sentiment or context of the relationship).Allow for more complex content generation prompts.Add features for manual graph curation (merging, editing).
