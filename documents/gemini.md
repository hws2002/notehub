Hello! I need your help building a prototype for a personalized knowledge graph viewer based on my ChatGPT history. Please follow these guidelines for our collaboration.1. Project GoalThe primary goal is to quickly build a working prototype that visualizes concepts from a ChatGPT JSON export as an interactive graph. We want to be able to see the main ideas, identify gaps in our knowledge, and use AI to generate new content.2. Core Philosophy: Prototype First, Polish LaterTechnology Stack: Do not worry about the "perfect" technical stack. For this initial phase, let's prioritize speed and simplicity. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file is the ideal starting point. This allows us to see results immediately without complex setup.No Heavy Frameworks: Please do not use large frontend frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js for the initial prototype. We can consider those later if needed. Simple, dependency-free code is best. For graph visualization, a library like Vis.js or D3.js (loaded from a CDN) is acceptable.Focus on Functionality: Our main priority is implementing the core features, even in a basic way. We need to prove the concept works before we invest time in making it scalable or beautiful.3. Development Framework: Step-by-StepPlease help me build this project one step at a time. I will ask for help on each of these steps sequentially.Step 1: Data Processing and Basic VisualizationTask: Write a JavaScript function that can parse a sample ChatGPT JSON file.Input: A JSON structure containing a list of conversations.Process:Extract the text content from all messages.Perform simple text analysis to identify the top 20-30 most frequent keywords (nouns are a good starting point). These will be our "nodes."Create "edges" (connections) between keywords that appear in the same message or close to each other.Use a library (like Vis.js) to render these nodes and edges in a simple force-directed graph.Step 2: AI-Powered Knowledge ExtractionTask: Instead of simple keyword counting, let's use an AI call to get better nodes.Process:Write a function that takes a chunk of text from a conversation.This function should make an API call to a generative model (like the Gemini API).The prompt should be something like: "Extract the 5 most important topics or concepts from the following text. Respond with a JSON array of strings. Text: [text chunk]"We will use the results from this API call as our nodes.Step 3: AI for Gap Analysis and Content GenerationTask: Add features to interact with the graph using AI.Process:Gap Analysis: When a user clicks a node with very few connections, create a button. Clicking it will call the Gemini API with a prompt like: "The topic is '[Node Name]'. What related topics are missing to form a complete understanding?"Content Generation: When a user selects two or more nodes, create a button. Clicking it will call the Gemini API with a prompt like: "Brainstorm 3 creative ideas that connect the concepts of '[Node A Name]' and '[Node B Name]'."Let's start with Step 1. Thank you!
